* Tukana - A General Purpose Knowledge Tracking Application

/"Great books are meant to be read, then read again backwards or upside down!" â€”Ettovard, Tolarian archivist/

** What is it? 
Tukana is a self-hosted general knowledge store, meant for tracking books, podcasts, papers, and other forms of information you want to keep around. 
*** What it does:
1. Tracks your books, podcasts, and papers. 
2. Tags the things you've learned and read
3. Set notes and log items for rereading. 
4. Set goals for papers and books.
5. Export list of what you've read. 

** Why? 
I end up consuming a lot of books and papers, and I've always wanted a nice way to track them, without having a weird social aspect tacked onto it. Tukana aims to solve that, by allowing you to self-host a datastore of things you've read and consumed.
 
** Integrations
- Pinboard for general tracking
- Altemetric API for papers
- isbndb for books
- ??? for podcasts
