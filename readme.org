* Tukana - A General Purpose Knowledge Tracking Application

"Great books are meant to be read, then read again backwards or upside down!" â€” /Ettovard, Tolarian archivist/

** What is it? 
Tukana is a self-hosted general knowledge store, meant for tracking books, podcasts, papers, and other forms of information you want to keep around. 
*** What it does:
1. Tracks your books, podcasts, and papers. 
2. Tags the things you've learned and read
3. Set notes and log items for rereading. 
4. Set goals for papers and books.
5. Export list of what you've read. 

** Why? 
I end up consuming a lot of books and papers, and I've always wanted a nice way to track them, without having a weird social aspect tacked onto it. Tukana aims to solve that, by allowing you to self-host a datastore of things you've read and consumed.
 
** Integrations
- Pinboard for general tracking
- Altemetric API for papers
- isbndb for books
- ??? for podcasts

** Tech Details:
*** Why is stuff stored as YAML? 
It's so that if you ever want to perform operations on your data, or write your own application on top of the data there's minimum barriers. Loading a /lot/ of YAML isn't fast, but that's why there's a database with a subset of the data. 
*** What's the naming format?
All your stuff is stored by its type:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
/books/
  |- Filename: <ISBN_NUMBER>.yaml 
  |- All books are identified by their ISBN number, or lacking that, their name.
/podcasts/
  |- Filename: <PODCAST_NAME>_<PODCAST_EPISODE>.yaml
  |- All podcasts are identified by their name, followed by their underscore, then the episode number
/papers/
  |- Filename: <GIVEN_NAME>.yaml
  |- This one is wonky, it's the one of the two that uses a user-defined name. This may change in the future once I figure out a better way of tagging papers. 
/other/
  |- Filename: <GIVEN_NAME>.yaml
  |- Same as papers, everything else gets shoved with a user-defined name. 
#+END_SRC
